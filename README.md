# Bakery App
Welcome to our Frontend React application! This project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This README file will guide you through the steps to install and run the application using npm (Node Package Manager).
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites
Please ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
1. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is automatically installed with Node.js.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**: 
`git clone https://github.com/cuber15/bakery.git `

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
`cd bakery`

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
`npm install`

## Running the Application
After you have completed the installation and configuration steps, you are ready to run the application locally on your machine:
`npm start`

This command will start the development server, and the application should be accessible at http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.
